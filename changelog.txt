  options (net_vcr) and no more IPX or Serial/Modem networking either.

  having more than one sky texture in glquake.

  first baby step before looking at some decent texture management.

v0.46
=====
- Fixed default vidmodes in windows, software NQ/QW (broken in v0.0.39 I think)
- Fixed sound channel selection broken in v0.45
